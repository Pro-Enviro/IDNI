        <p>
          This can only be obtained if your energy company records your consumption data on a half hourly basis.
          To obtain half-hourly meter data, you need to either download it or contact your electricity or utility provider to request it. They should be able to provide you with access to your half-hourly consumption data upon request.

           <h4 class="text-lg">•	Contact Your Utility Provider</h4>
           Start by reaching out to your electricity or utility provider. They should have information on whether your meter supports half-hourly data recording and how you can access it.
         </li>
         <li class="p-2">
           <h4 class="text-lg">•	Request Access</h4>
           Once you've confirmed that your meter supports half-hourly data recording, check first if you can download the half-hourly data from your online energy account, if not then send a request to your energy supplier.
         </li>
         <li class="p-2">
           <h4 class="text-lg">•	Provide Information</h4>
           Depending on your provider's procedures, you may need to provide some information such as your account details, meter number, and possibly consent to access the data.
         </li>
         <li class="p-2">
           <h4 class="text-lg">•	Access the Data</h4>
           After you've completed any necessary steps, you should be able to access your half-hourly meter data. This may be through an online portal downloadable file, by email, or through other means provided by your utility company.
         </li>
         <li class="p-2">
           <h4 class="text-lg">•	Analyse the Data</h4>
           Once you have access to your half-hourly meter data, you can analyse it to gain insights into your electricity usage patterns. This can be useful for identifying opportunities to reduce energy consumption, optimise energy usage, or for other purposes such as billing verification.

      <p-accordionTab header="What is The Productivity & Emissions Tool (PET) ?">
        <p>The ID-NI Productivity & Emissions Tool (PET) is a unique and powerful tool that is easy to use and quick to provide key insights for business improvement.
          By measuring the various factors that impact Productivity we can also,
          when blended with some additional information, enable your business to begin to measure your Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions at your site.</p>
        <p>The important distinction for our PET is that it is not just about measuring how productive you are, it is highlighting those main factors that are impacting that productivity score and therefore determining your performance. Likewise we can calculate your emissions, using the same factors that determine your Productivity, to show how and where you are performing well or poorly.
          The low hanging fruit will typically be those areas that are high cost and high emissions, by solving one you improve the other.</p>
        <p>
         Productivity is well understood and easily measured in a number ways by any economist. As a business term,
          it is roughly understood but seldom calculated. The Office of National Statistics have provided a clear model for how businesses should calculate their own Productivity based on their business Turnover on
          their particular site, the number of employees at that site and the total external costs incurred at that site. The ID-NI Productivity & Emissions Tool PET goes a few steps further.
          Our PET is designed to not only focus on the main Factors those external costs, bring clarity to those costs, allow the company to begin measurement to those costs, both financially and in emissions generated.
