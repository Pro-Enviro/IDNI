      <h3 class="header-style">The Productivity & Emissions Tool</h3>
      <p>The ID-NI Productivity & Emissions Tool (PET) is a unique and powerful tool that is easy to use and quick to provide key insights for business improvement.  By measuring the various factors that impact Productivity we can also, when blended with some additional information, enable your business to begin to measure your Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions at your site.</p>
      <p>The important distinction for our PET is that it is not just about measuring how productive you are, it is highlighting those main factors that are impacting that productivity score and therefore determining your performance.  Likewise we can calculate your emissions, using the same factors that determine your Productivity, to show how and where you are performing well or poorly.  The low hanging fruit will typically be those areas that are high cost and high emissions, by solving one you improve the other.</p>
      <p>Productivity is well understood and easily measured in a number ways by any economist.  As a business term, it is roughly understood but seldom calculated.  The Office of National Statistics have provided a clear model for how businesses should calculate their own Productivity based on their business Turnover on their particular site, the number of employees at that site and the total external costs incurred at that site.  The ID-NI Productivity & Emissions Tool PET goes a few steps further.  Our PET is designed to not only focus on the main Factors those external costs, bring clarity to those costs, allow the company to begin measurement to those costs, both financially and in emissions generated.</p>
      <h3 class="header-style">Using the PET Tool</h3>
      <p>There are 4 levels of engagement using the PET tool.  At no stage will one business be able to identify and see another businesses data.  Levels 1 & 2 are free to use, Level 1 is available to everyone but only businesses that have agreed to share their data for the ID-NI project will be able to use Level 2.  Level 3 is also free to use but is only available to companies who have been selected as part of a regional cluster of companies.  Like level 2, level 3 requires that the company has agreed to share their data with the project.  All Level 2 companies who have submitted accurate data will receive charts profiling their energy usage, an indication of the Scope 2 emissions and an initial plan for decarbonisation.  Level 3 companies will received a more detailed decarbonisation plan highlighting how they can save money and reduce their Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  They will also have a 1 day site visit and an individual detailed report.  Level 4 is self funded but also requires the company to share their data with the project.  It is subject to negotiation between the  company and the assessor but cover something equivalent to a Level 3 assessment or may deliver a much more detailed decarbonisation strategy for the business or them signing up to the Science Based Targets Initiative SBTI at an additional cost.</p>
      <h3>Level 1</h3>
      <p>The open access level 1, PET tool is located on the ID-NI Knowledge Sharing Platform.  It only  has the Productivity capability available.  If a company inputs their data at Level 1 access their data will not be stored.  Unless when prompted they agree to share their data, as which point they are granted Level 2 access.  If they do not agree then not data will be stored and only their productivity information will be used to see how productive they are compared to other companies of a similar size or from the same sector are performing.  They will be asked to complete the following fields</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Turnover (£)</li>
        <li>No. of Employees</li>
        <li>Cost of Energy (£)</li>
        <li>Cost of Raw Materials (£)</li>
        <li>Cost of Bought in Parts and Equipment (motors, drives, batteries etc)  (£)</li>
        <li>Cost of Waste and Water (£)</li>
        <li>Cost of Transport and Travel (£)</li>
        <li>Consultancy Costs (Technical, Financial, Marketing etc) (£)</li>
        <li>Cost of Sub Contracted Manufacture (£)</li>
        <li>Other External Costs (Rent, Legal etc) (£)</li>
        <li>Your SIC Code</li>
        <li class="font-semibold">Note: Do not include internal salary and labour costs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>From this we will be able to calculate your current productivity score for this site and show how you are performing compared to the average company in you sector or of a similar size.</p>
      <h3>Level 2</h3>
      <p>Level 2 access will require the company to agree to share their data with the project.  The company will provide the same productivity information as outlined in Level 1 but must also send or upload their ½ hourly energy data ( Electric and or Gas).  As the complete each of the productivity factors they will be prompted to provide additional information.  For example when they put in their total energy cost and send the1/2 hourly data they will then be asked to breakdown the different types of energy and fuels they use at their site.  In transport they will be asked to identify the different modes of transport they use.</p>
