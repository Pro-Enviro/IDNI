Individual days within the period are on the horizontal axis, while the 24 hours of each day are on the vertical axis in half-hourly increments. The colours represent different levels of consumption; red being the highest, and white being the lowest (see legend above chart).\n',
  'Scatter':'The following two charts show the daily consumption levels across the year. Both charts show each day of the week as a different colour.',
  'Pie': 'The pie chart shows that across the 12-month period XX% of the consumption occurred during the weekend. Consumption on each day of the week was consistent but with lower levels seen on Fridays due to the earlier finish.',
  'Lowest': 'A review of consumption levels over the Christmas period is often a good way of establishing a company’s base load energy use when there is the lowest level of activity on the site.\n' +

    'During Christmas Day 20XX the total consumption was XXX kWh and as can be seen below, there was a base load averaging [Yx2] kW (Y kWh per half hour). Using the effective rate this equates to a cost of £XXX per day. The lowest day of the year was found on the XX/XX/XX, the consumption on this day was XXX kWh at a cost of £XXXX.\n',
  'Avg': 'The graph below shows the average daily consumption pattern across the year.',
  'Demand':'The company has an authorised supply capacity (ASC) of XXX kVA which carries an annual charge of ~£XXXX based on the current supply contract charges. The ASC is the agreed maximum supply capacity, measured in kVA, which a customer is authorised to take from the distribution system through their connection point. Customers pay a monthly charge for each unit of capacity.\n' +
